He awoke to the huge, insect like creatures looming over his bed and screamed his lungs out. .<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Neuroscience and a minor in Computational Neuroscience from the University of Washington in Seattle (UW).</p>
<p>I am highly interested in bridging the gap between computer science and Neuroscience. I believe that by understanding the human brain, we will be able to build better artificial intelligence, and this is where I see Neuroscience and technology coming together. Information processing done by the brain, if understood, can be a great tool in building artificial intelligence that is more intuitive and efficient. In other words, Neuroscience has the potential to be a great source of inspiration for entire new sets of lines of knowledge and algorithms. Actually, by understanding the brain we could begin to validate current artificial intelligence methods as well as guide us towards where resources should be invested more efficiently. I also love playing tennis, reading and cats!</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> I have worked in fields like Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Simple robotics with Raspberry Pi and Web Development until now, and I'm working on learning new things. You can learn more about me on my <a href="https://manuelad8.wixsite.com/manueladn"> portfolio</a>.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>One thing you may notice about me is that I love solving challenges and like to challenge myself to learn all the time. I like solving competitive coding problems and I am interested in getting more involded in robotics. <br><br><br>Do you want to see some of my completed projects? <a href="https://manuelad8.wixsite.com/manueladn"> Here you go</a>.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
