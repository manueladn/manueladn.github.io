A few nights ago, I awoke to the huge, insect like creatures looming over my bed and screamed my lungs out. They hastily left the room and I stayed up all night, shaking and wondering if it had been a dream.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>The next morning, there was a tap on the door. Gathering my courage, I opened it to see one of them gently place a plate filled with fried breakfast on the floor, then retreat to a safe distance. Bewildered, I accepted the gift. The creatures chittered excitedly.This happened every day for weeks. At first I was worried they were fattening me up, but after a particularly greasy breakfast left me clutching me chest from heartburn, they were replaced with fresh fruit. As well as cooking, they poured hot steamy baths for me and even tucked me in when I went to bed. It was bizarre.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>One night, I awoke to gunshots and screaming. I raced downstairs to find a decapitated burglar being devoured by the insects. I was sickened, but disposed of the remains as best I could. I knew they had just been protecting me.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>One morning the creatures wouldn't let me leave my room. I lay down, confused but trusting as they ushered me back into bed. Whatever their motives, they weren't going to hurt me. Hours later a burning pain spread throughout my body. It felt like my stomach was filled with razor wire. The insects chittered as I spasmed and moaned.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>It was only when I felt a terrible squirming feeling beneath my skin that I realized the insects hadn't been protecting me. They had been protecting their young.</a>.</p>
