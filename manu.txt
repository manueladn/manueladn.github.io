He awoke to the huge, insect like creatures looming over his bed and screamed his lungs out. They hastily left the room and he stayed up all night, shaking and wondering if it had been a dream.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>The next morning, there was a tap on the door. Gathering his courage, he opened it to see one of them gently place a plate filled with fried breakfast on the floor, then retreat to a safe distance. Bewildered, he accepted the gift. The creatures chittered excitedly.This happened every day for weeks. At first he was worried they were fattening him up, but after a particularly greasy breakfast left him clutching his chest from heartburn, they were replaced with fresh fruit. As well as cooking, they poured hot steamy baths for him and even tucked him in when he went to bed. It was bizarre.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>One night, he awoke to gunshots and screaming. He raced downstairs to find a decapitated burglar being devoured by the insects. He was sickened, but disposed of the remains as best he could. He knew they had just been protecting him.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>One morning the creatures wouldn't let him leave his room. He lay down, confused but trusting as they ushered him back into bed. Whatever their motives, they weren't going to hurt him.Hours later a burning pain spread throughout his body. It felt like his stomach was filled with razor wire. The insects chittered as he spasmed and moaned.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>It was only when he felt a terrible squirming feeling beneath his skin that he realized the insects hadn't been protecting him. They had been protecting their young.</a>.</p>
